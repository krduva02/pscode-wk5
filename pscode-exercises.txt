// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Enter 1 number
Divide number by 2
Print on the screen the result of the divided number
If result equals whole number print on screen even
If result equals decimal print on screen odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Enter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
(1+2+3+4+5)/5
Print average

Average of the five numbers is 3

If(1 > 2) min is 2 
Else min is 1 
If(3 < min) min is 3 
If(4 < min) min is 4 
If(5 < min) min is 5 
Print "The smallest is" 
Print min

The smallest is 1

If(1 < 2) max is 2 
Else max is 1
If(3 > max) max is 3 
If(4 > max) max is 4 
If(n5 > max) max is 5 
Print "The largest is" 
Print max 

The largest is 5
